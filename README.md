## Preamble
a sheep herder and a visitor are standing at a gate while the sheep are quickly passing through.
* the visitor: "how many sheep are there?"
* sheep herder: "129"
* visitor: "that's amazing, how can you figure that out so fast?"
* sheep herder: "it's easy; you count all the legs, and divide by 4."

## About timelapse_long_videos
script to use OpenCV in python to take a folder of long videos, and shorten them to drop frames so the video plays faster... 
then combines them all into one video.

## Requirements
you need to install OpenCV first.. I used "pip3 install opencv-python"

## How to configure:
look for the line in the script that say:<br>
<code>time_lapse_video(input_path, output_path, 150)</code><br>
and change the 150 to 300 for mega warp speed, or 50 to just be much faster than normal, or 10 to be faster than normal. this value describes how many frames the script should drop before it keeps a frame when it's creating a new video.
